    <subject>Introducing HELO - Our JUMBO Reverse Mortgage Product</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

The traditional FHA Reverse Mortgage product has limitations that can exclude some of your clients. So we created our own proprietary mortgage solution. HELO allows many clients with higher home values, condominiums, solar panels and other FHA-restricted home features to qualify and take advantage of all the benefits a reverse mortgage can offer!

The below outlines the features of our HELO.
