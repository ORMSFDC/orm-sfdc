    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

ORMS has exciting news you’ll want to know about! Introducing our newest mortgage product – say hello to HELO! Short for Home Equity Loan Optimizer, HELO was created by One Reverse Mortgage Services as a more inclusive option for borrowers

The key features of our HELO include:

1. The max loan amount for HELO is $4 million, compared to only $509,738 for the HECM. This makes it a great option for clients with high-value homes.
2. There is more flexibility on property types, opening the reverse mortgage up to many borrowers with condominiums, solar panels, and other home features that do not qualify for the HECM.
3. A Mortgage Insurance Premium is not required, meaning your clients will have access to more money at lower costs.
4. There are no fund restrictions at closing. Your clients can take as much of their proceeds as they want from the moment they close.

Let us tell you how much your clients could receive with HELO. Please review the fact sheet attached in this email and call me today. I can give you even more information on this exciting new product and tell you how it can benefit your clients.

I know you have borrowers who can benefit from HELO, help them become some of the first clients to get this exclusive, new product from One Reverse Mortgage Services!

Best,
