    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.Preferred_First_Name__c},

You’ve probably seen the news – older folks are no longer comfortable living on Social Security alone:

Since 2000, the cost of living has outpaced Social Security benefits by 34%.
Many seniors rely on Social Security for 90% of their income.
Social Security’s trust fund is projected to run out by 2034 – that’s a 21% reduction in benefits.

More than ever, seniors need to supplement their income.

That’s where a HECM can come in handy. When can we chat this week about how to present this to senior borrowers?
