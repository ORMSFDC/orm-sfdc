    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.Preferred_First_Name__c},

Purchase season is in full swing, and luckily for your 62+ clients, you have access to a special loan option that allows them to buy a new home without making monthly mortgage payments. Itâ€™s called the HECM for Purchase (H4P), and it lets your clients use a reverse mortgage to buy a home.

Check out our presentation that you can show to your clients when explaining the HECM for Purchase (H4P): https://p.widencdn.net/hdcrpv/PP-HECMForPurchasePresentation-20190325 

What questions do you have about the H4P?
