    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.Preferred_First_Name__c},

Our newest product, the Home Equity Loan Optimizer (HELO), was recently featured in this article from the Wall Street Journal:

Senior Homeowners Give Reverse Jumbo Mortgages New Life.

If your clients have heard rumors about the product, sharing articles from top news organizations like this can help clear up misconceptions so clients can move forward with confidence.

Of course, I am always a resource for answering client questions, overcoming objections and setting the facts straight!  What questions do you have for me?
